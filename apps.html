        <h1>Welcome to my portfolio</h1>
<p>My name is Adrian Hour, a student at URI and this will be my online portfolio for CSC106.
The website is supposed to showcase all of digital projects and accomplishments. This in fact is my very <strong>first</strong> website that I have created through html.
I am excited to showcase my projects with you!
